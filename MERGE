---- one record is matching between source to target in terms of employee id
---- we are asking to use the source table's content to UPSERT operation
---- when employee id is matching, then use the name in source table to update the target table
---- when not matched , if the row in the source table employee name start with S
---- then do insert to the target table
---- when not matched , if the row in the target table employee name start with S
---- then delete the target row

----creating source and target tables
CREATE TABLE dbo.Target(EmployeeID int, EmployeeName varchar(10), 
     CONSTRAINT Target_PK PRIMARY KEY(EmployeeID));
CREATE TABLE dbo.Source(EmployeeID int, EmployeeName varchar(10), 
     CONSTRAINT Source_PK PRIMARY KEY(EmployeeID));
GO
INSERT dbo.Target(EmployeeID, EmployeeName) VALUES(100, 'Mary');
INSERT dbo.Target(EmployeeID, EmployeeName) VALUES(101, 'Sara');
INSERT dbo.Target(EmployeeID, EmployeeName) VALUES(102, 'Stefano');

GO
INSERT dbo.Source(EmployeeID, EmployeeName) Values(103, 'Bob');
INSERT dbo.Source(EmployeeID, EmployeeName) Values(104, 'Steve');
INSERT INTO dbo.source(EmployeeID, EmployeeName) values (100,'Mike');
GO


select 'source',* from dbo.source ;
go
select 'target',* from dbo.target;

---SOLUTION

MERGE Target AS T
USING Source AS S
ON (T.EmployeeID = S.EmployeeID) 
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET AND S.EmployeeName LIKE 'S%' 
    THEN INSERT(EmployeeID, EmployeeName) VALUES(S.EmployeeID, S.EmployeeName)
WHEN MATCHED 
    THEN UPDATE SET T.EmployeeName = S.EmployeeName
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE AND T.EmployeeName LIKE 'S%'
    THEN DELETE 
OUTPUT $action, inserted.*, deleted.*;


select * from Target
